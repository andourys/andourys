# My Interest and Experience

ðŸ¤¨ My interest has always been game development, ever since my young years I'd look up how to program, design, animate games. I have been through scratch, flash, you call it. I saw actual IDE's in 2016 but was way too young to utilize these, so I went for a simpler solution which was GameMaker Studio 1.4. A more 2D directed engine I had been using for 2 years or so. I have come to Roblox a long time ago but only have started my coding career ever since pandemic lockdown, I have experience with Python for 4 years, JavaScript for around a year and have picked up C# earlier this year. You see me a lot on the Roblox platform but I also am slowly getting myself used to other game-engines to work with. 

ðŸŽ‰ Im enrolling into an university directed towards game development *(game engineering to be specific)* this october! You'll see me less active on social platforms & possibly github. (If I ever come to actually use it... ðŸ¤£)
