### Hi there! 👋

I'm andy, also known as **andyaspect/AnimatedAspect** on the online world.
- If you have the interest in contacting me, feel free to reach out on **my socials** or on **as@omg.lol** 😊
- Pronouns are he/they! 🙂

# My interest and experience

🤨 My interest has always been game development, ever since my young years I'd look up how to program, design, animate games. I have been through scratch, flash, you call it. I saw actual IDE's in 2016 but was way too young to utilize these, so I went for a simpler solution which was GameMaker Studio 1.4. A more 2D directed engine I had been using for 2 years or so. I have come to Roblox a long time ago but only have started my coding career ever since pandemic lockdown, I have experience with Python for 4 years, JavaScript for around a year and have picked up C# earlier this year. You see me a lot on the Roblox platform but I also am slowly getting myself used to other game-engines to work with. 

🎉 Im enrolling into an university directed towards game development *(game engineering to be specific)* this october! You'll see me less active on social platforms & possibly github. (If I ever come to actually use it... 🤣)

# 🤫 I’m currently working on ...

#### @ Voidpoint • Founder, Tech, Design and Community Management
- 🔫 Voidpoint: Revolvia 

#### @ Emotes CO. • Tech and Community Management

# ⭐ My plans...

### First and foremost, I look forward moving onto the Unity Engine!
- I've always been passionate about creating things I love on an engine where I can control more than just instances and a workspace. (no flame intended lol)
- I'm really and I mean really looking forward to recreate a similar concept of **Voidpoint: Revolvia** as a standalone game in the future, whereas I won't give out news yet. 👀

### Strengthen my skills
- Every language I've listed as doable has been self taught via online documents and just videos, with my upcoming scholarship I look forward to improve 10 times more than before.
- I also want to take on more languages such as C++ incase some other game engine is limited to it. (looking at you, unreal engine 👀)

### Contribute on GitHub

- I want to move out of the little roblox only cage and contribute! If I feel somethings up on my interest I'll most likely help contribute. Don't expect much from me though, I'm far from an expert 😅
